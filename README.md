# Finvest Stokvel Finder Project

## Overview
This project explores how traditional stokvels—community-based savings groups—can evolve through digital transformation. While stokvels have served communities for generations, they face challenges such as limited accessibility, lack of transparency, inefficiency, and no formal credit recognition. As younger generations shift toward digital banking, the need for modern, tech-enabled stokvels is growing. This project aims to present a future model that maintains the cultural value of stokvels while improving trust, efficiency, inclusivity, and long-term financial growth.

## Features
- Search existing stokvels by name.
- View popular stokvel groups with details such as type, contribution, members, and establishment year.
- Submit preferences to receive AI-powered stokvel recommendations.
- Join stokvel groups via a dedicated application form.
- User registration and login functionality.
- Loan application process (separate feature).

## Project Structure
- `stokvel.html`: Main page for finding and joining stokvels.
- `join.html`: Application form page for joining a selected stokvel.
- `registration.html`: User registration and login page.
- `apply.html`: Loan application page.
- `dashboard.html`: User dashboard (assumed).
- `server/`: Backend server code including routes, middleware, and models.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.

## Development/Tech Stack
- Frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Backend is implemented in Node.js (assumed from server files).
- API endpoints for user registration and login are available.
- No current backend API for stokvel joining; application form submission is frontend-only.

## Future Improvements
- Implement backend API to handle stokvel join applications.
- Add user authentication checks before allowing stokvel join applications.
- Enhance AI recommendation engine with real data.
- Improve UI/UX for mobile responsiveness.

## Running the Project
- Ensure Node.js is installed.
- Install dependencies with `npm install` (if applicable).
- Start the backend server (e.g., `node server/server.js`).
- Open the frontend HTML files in a browser or serve them via a local server.
